# Contributing to this repository

We welcome your contributions! There are multiple ways to contribute.

## Opening issues

For bugs or enhancement requests, please file a GitHub issue unless it's
security related. When filing a bug remember that the better written the bug is,
the more likely it is to be fixed. If you think you've found a security
vulnerability, do not raise a GitHub issue and follow the instructions in our
[security policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Contributing code

We welcome your code contributions. Before submitting code via a pull request,
you will need to have signed the [Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA] (OCA) and
your commits need to include the following line using the name and e-mail
address you used to sign the OCA:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with `--sign-off`
or `-s`, e.g.

```text
git commit --signoff
```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having signed the OCA
can be accepted.
